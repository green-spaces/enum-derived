  = help: the following other types implement trait `Distribution<T>`:
            <Standard as Distribution<()>>
            <Standard as Distribution<(A, B)>>
            <Standard as Distribution<(A, B, C)>>

            <Standard as Distribution<(A, B, C, D, E, F)>>
            <Standard as Distribution<(A, B, C, D, E, F, G)>>
            <Standard as Distribution<(A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H)>>
          and $N others
  = note: required for `String` to implement `Rand`
  = note: this error originates in the derive macro `Rand` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
