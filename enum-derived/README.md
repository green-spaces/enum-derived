# Enum-Derived

Use Enum-Derived's Rand macro to generate random variants of your enums and structs. All fields are populated with independent random values.

Need custom constraints applied to a variant or field? Use the `#[custom_rand(your_function)]` attribute to override the default behavior or extend support to types without default support.

Need some variants to be generated more ofter? Use the `#[weight(VARIANT_WEIGHT)]` to change the distribution.

## Rand

Rand allows for a random variant of an enum, or struct, to be generated.

The [rand] crates [rand::random] method is used for the default implementation of [Rand]. Unsupported variants can us the `#[custom_rand(your_function)]` to extend the functionality.

```rust
use enum_derived::Rand;

#[derive(Rand)]
struct Weather {
    wind_speed: u8,
    #[custom_rand(rand_temp)]
    temperature: f32,
    cloudy: bool
}

#[derive(Rand)]
enum TravelLog {
    Airplane {
        weather: Weather,
        altitude: u16
    },
    Boat(
        Weather,
        #[custom_rand(rand_boat_speed)]
        u32,
    ),
    #[custom_rand(always_has_sunroof)]
    Car {
        has_sunroof: bool,
    },
    #[weight(3)]
    SpaceShip,
}

fn main() {
    let travel_log = TravelLog::rand();
}

# fn always_has_sunroof() -> TravelLog {
#     TravelLog::Car { has_sunroof: true }
# }
#
# fn rand_boat_speed() -> u32 {
#     thread_rng().gen_range(5..50)
# }
# 
# fn rand_temp() -> f32 {
#    thread_rng().gen_range(-20.0..120.0)
# }
# 
# use rand::{thread_rng, Rng};
 ```
